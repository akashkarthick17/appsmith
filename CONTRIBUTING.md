## How to set up local development

### Client

##### Pre-requisites:

1. You have `docker` installed in your system. If not, please visit: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. You have `mkcert` installed. Please visit: [https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation) for details.
3. You have `envsubst` installed. use `brew install gettext` on macOS. Linux machines usually have this installed.
4. You have cloned the repo in your local machine.

##### Create local HTTPS certificates:

1. Run the following command from the project root.

```bash
cd app/client/docker && mkcert -install && mkcert "*.appsmith.com" && cd ..
```

This command will end up creating 2 files in the `docker/` directory:

- `_wildcard.appsmith.com-key.pem`
- `_wildcard.appsmith.com.pem`

2. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename the new file to `.env` in the same directory. Populate the entries in the `.env` file with values to enable/toggle features.

3. Run the script `[start-https.sh](http://start-https.sh)` in order to start the nginx container that will proxy the frontend code on your local system.

##### Steps to build & run the code:

1. Add a domain like `dev.appsmith.com` to `/etc/hosts`. 

```bash
echo "127.0.0.1	dev.appsmith.com" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

1. With the working directory as `app/client`; Run `yarn`

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `yarn build` (optional)
3. Run `yarn start` if you are hitting `[https://release-api.appsmith.com](https://release-api.appsmith.com)` (Staging environment) as your API backend.
4. If you are hitting any other API endpoint, 
    1. Please run:

    ```jsx
    REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=DEVELOPMENT HOST=dev.appsmith.com craco start
    ```

    2. Change the API endpoint in the Nginx configuration available in `docker/templates/nginx-linux.conf.template` or `docker/templates/nginx-mac.conf.template`

5. Go to [https://dev.appsmith.com](https://dev.appsmith.com) on your browser

#### If you are unable to run docker:

1. Make the values inÂ `nginx-mac.conf.template`Â empty. None of the properties are required.
2. `proxy_pass`Â value must be changed fromÂ `[http://host.docker.internal:3000](http://host.docker.internal:3000/)`Â toÂ `[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)`
3. Generate the certificates manually viaÂ `mkcert`. Check the command inÂ `start-https-server.sh`Â file.
4. Change the value of the certificate location for keysÂ `ssl_certificate`Â &Â `ssl_certificate_key`Â to the place where these certificates were generated.
